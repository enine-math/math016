# Problem No. 16

## Power Digit Sum

$2^{15} = 32768$ and the sum of its digits is $3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26$.

## Part A

What is the sum of the digits of the number $2^{1000}$?

Edit the file answer.py and update the function `answer()` to return the answer.

## Part B

Generalize the solution in Part A for n and return the sum of the digits of the number $2^{n}$.

Update the function `solver()` in `solver.py` with your generalized solution.

```python
solver()
```
